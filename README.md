### Weather-App
![Weather-App](https://github.com/Sandstorm831/Learning-react/tree/main/weather-app) is a simple web app which gives you weather of any city in the world. I have made this app very resilient, as it can not overwhealm the server by several identical API requests. In it I have implemented a debouncer, which debounces any API request that is made withing 250 milliseconds of the previous request, I have implemented an API aborter which aborts any API request that is not resolved untill now and a new API request is made. I have rendered the weather icons with the help of [weather-react-icons](https://github.com/taichi-t/weather-react-icons) library, they render weather icons with the weather codes and [Open Weather Map](https://www.openweathermap.org) API gives weather icon codes to render icons. Made a global loading state which shows a little gesture of [ loading . | loading .. | loading ... ] with time, it was fun to make as upto this point my code have gotten vast enough that I myself was forgetting what components does themselves. Also incorporated focus shifter click outside functionality which hides non essential things when clicked outside that component, It also has to be made global thus, I learnt createContext() and useContext() deeply through this. I have used TailWindCSS in it for styling, and it was quite comfortable to handle once you know the basic stuff and I have tried to make the UI somewhat lively and playfull with a somewhat easy-to-read stuff. I have learnt a lot of stuff through this project.

### Recipe-App
![Recipe-App](https://github.com/Sandstorm831/Learning-react/tree/main/recipie-app) is a web app (but not very simple) which gives recipes of various kind of dishes. You just have to input one of the ingredients of the recipe, and if the recipe shows up, you can click on *recipe details* button, through which you will land on the recipe details page. From there you can read the recipe and if you want to save the recipe, you can click the *Add to Favourites* button to add the recipe to favourites page. To view your saved favourites recipe, you just have to click on *Favourites* button in top-right corner to go to the favourites page. To create various pages, I have used react-router-dom library, and also used *useContext* extensively as most of my states are set to have global context. Designed all 4 pages with TailWindCSS. Used *useParams* hook to access id of the recipes in the global context and also taken *useNavigation* to automatically take user back and forth from different pages on certain functionalities.

### Shopping-Cart
![Shopping-Cart](https://github.com/Sandstorm831/Learning-react/tree/main/shopping_cart) is a normal shopping cart app, not very much different to above Recipe-App but in two ways. First, it displays consumer items and not recipes and second for state management it uses redux instead of *Context*. Ironically I have not implemented the redux part only, but developed the UI and data fetching from API and other stuff. So this project currently under development and will be completed in a soon.
