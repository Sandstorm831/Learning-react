## Frontend Development Project

---
#### Steps to preview the project :
- Extract the zip file in a `Folder`
- Open a terminal and type the following commands :

    ```
    cd ./{Folder}/Project
    npm install // mot necessary, just to be on safe side for all dependencies 
    npm run dev
    ```
- After running `npm run dev` the frontend will be deployed, the `localhost:port` will be visible in front.

#### Project details
- Project is written in `React` with `Vite` as build tool. I have used `TailWindCSS` as a CSS Framework and `Recoil` for state management.
- The project is written in a very structured way :
    - All the components are present in `./src/components` directory
    - All the state `Atoms` are present in `./store/atoms` directory
    - Any images used in a component, will be present in that component folder only.
    - All components are assembled into one single component in `./App.jsx` file.
- I have not added any functionality, as indicated in the guidelines of the assignment, but I want to let you know that, all the functionalities or different kind of animated gesture can be implemented if required.
