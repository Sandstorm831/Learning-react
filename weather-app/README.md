### Weather-App
Weather-App is a simple web app which gives you weather of any city in the world. I have made this app very resilient, as it can not overwhealm the server by several identical API requests. In it I have implemented a debouncer, which debounces any API request that is made withing 250 milliseconds of the previous request, I have implemented an API aborter which aborts any API request that is not resolved untill now and a new API request is made. I have rendered the weather icons with the help of [weather-react-icons](https://github.com/taichi-t/weather-react-icons) library, they render weather icons with the weather codes and [Open Weather Map](https://www.openweathermap.org) API gives weather icon codes to render icons. Made a global loading state which shows a little gesture of [ loading . | loading .. | loading ... ] with time, it was fun to make as upto this point my code have gotten vast enough that I myself was forgetting what components does themselves. Also incorporated focus shifter click outside functionality which hides non essential things when clicked outside that component, It also has to be made global thus, I learnt createContext() and useContext() deeply through this. I have used TailWindCSS in it for styling, and it was quite comfortable to handle once you know the basic stuff and I have tried to make the UI somewhat lively and playfull with a somewhat easy-to-read stuff. I have learnt a lot of stuff through this project.
